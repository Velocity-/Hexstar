## What it will do
It'll most likely
 - be easy to download and install;
 - be easy to use and get rid of;
 - be capable of working with gigabyte-sized files;
 - have the ability to checksum, encrypt, decrypt and ruin your files;
 - have an awesome plugin API which will let other coders add nice plugins;
 - have a comprehensible layout and nice look and feel;
 - delete your Habbo Hotel account.

More features will get added when they are being considered.
